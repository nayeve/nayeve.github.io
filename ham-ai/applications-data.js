    detailedDescription: "Neural network-based noise reduction systems like RM Noise and RNNoise achieve breakthrough performance by learning spectral patterns that traditional DSP filters miss. Real-world testing by W6JW shows 12-18dB improvement in weak signal copy during high band noise conditions. The key insight: AI excels at removing correlated noise (power line hash, switching supplies) while preserving uncorrelated signal components. RNNoise processes 10ms frames with 22ms latency - acceptable for voice but challenging for CW timing. Critical implementation detail: pre-emphasis at 6kHz prevents neural network from treating treble as noise during band-limited HF conditions.",
